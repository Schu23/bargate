Bargate
=======

Bargate is a web interface to CIFS/SMB servers. It is written in Python, uses libsmbclient for talking to file servers (specifically, pysmbc) and the user interface is based on Twitter Bootstrap. Bargate has been developed to provide the 'Filestore Web Access' application at the University of Southampton: https://fwa.soton.ac.uk, however it has been written to allow third parties (especially other Universities) to utilise the application themselves.

If you're interested in using or extending Bargate please get in touch, especially if you're a UK academic institution. Development is happening at a rapid pace at the moment, so now is the time to contact us!

Because Bargate is written using Bootstrap 3 it is 'mobile first' and features a responsive design, making Bargate work equally well on phones, tablets or desktops. Bargate works with any SMB server that libsmbclient supports (essentially anything standards compliant).
