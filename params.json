  "body": "bargate\r\n=======\r\nbargate is a modern web interface to CIFS/SMB servers. It is written in Python and runs on Linux. Bargate was written to provide users with a way of accessing existing CIFS/SMB file servers from the web in a secure way. Bargate is currently in use at the University of Southampton and the University of Sheffield. If you're interested in using or extending Bargate please get in touch, especially if you're a UK academic institution. \r\n\r\nbargate is stable and production ready and under active development. \r\n\r\nBecause bargate is written using Bootstrap 3 it is 'mobile first' and features a responsive design, making Bargate work equally well on phones, tablets or desktops. Bargate works with any SMB server that libsmbclient supports (it is known to work with Samba, Windows, Isilon, NetApp and Novell file servers).\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n![screenshoot](http://davidrichardbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-21-at-19-30-55.png)\r\n![screenshoot](http://davidrichardbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-21-at-19-36-28.png)\r\n",
