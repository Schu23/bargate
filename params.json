{"name":"Bargate","tagline":"A feature-packed web interface to CIFS/SMB file servers. Developed for use at the University of Southampton.","body":"Bargate is a web interface to CIFS/SMB servers. It is written in Python, uses libsmbclient for talking to file servers (specifically, pysmbc) and the user interface is based on Twitter Bootstrap. Bargate has been developed to provide the 'Filestore Web Access' application at the University of Southampton: https://fwa.soton.ac.uk. As such the code currently here is entirely written for Southampton and would require quite a lot of re-writing to work elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to add features to Bargate in time to allow other people to use it without having to re-write a lot of code. If you're interested in using or extending Bargate please get in touch, especially if you're a UK academic institution. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
